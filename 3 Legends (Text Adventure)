# Write if statements with and ELSE with an error message to catch errors
# Never nest if statements more than 2 deep and do your best to keep it within 1.
# Keep your Boolean tests simple.

# use a while loop only when you want to loop forever
# other wise you should be using a for loop

# the best way to debug is to print often to see where in the code an error goes wrong
# Waterfall Model Test your code as you go

# Create your text adventure!
# it should have Monsters, Traps, Rooms, etc.
